# Nextride2-infobeamer
Nextride2-infobeamer is an extension for [Nextride2](https://github.com/HackerspaceBielefeld/Nextride2) and implements a simple solution to display images on screens running Nextride2. N2i allows you to create a queue of slides which can iteratively be displayed on the Nextride screens. N2i in general implements a CMS for user uploaded date. This can be used to allow guests and visitors to upload slides/ads they want to share. Extensions for N2i extend the CMS and allow full customization of the displayed content. It's also easy to write your own extension.
